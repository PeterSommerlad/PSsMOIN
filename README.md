# PSsMOIN
Simple Safer Integer Replacement types with Modular (Wrapping) Arithmetic for C++20

Note: This is a rename and extension of my earlier attempt in [PSsimplesafeint](https://github.com/PeterSommerlad/PSsimplesafeint), if you need wrap around integer replacement types for C++17 look there for the C++17 branch.

It completes the three approaches for adding safer integer arithmetic:

* overflow detection [PSsODIN](https://github.com/PeterSommerlad/PSsODIN)
* saturation arithmetic [PSsSATIN](https://github.com/PeterSommerlad/PSsSATIN)
